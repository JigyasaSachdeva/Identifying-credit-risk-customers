# Identifying-credit-risk-customers
Inferring decision rules from models to identify customers worthy enough for credit approval using data analysis and modeling. 

- Analyzing credit amount statistics for 1000 loan applicants 
- Identifying correlation between credit amount and duration of loan; credit amount and historical target (whether the customer was a good or bad loan applicant)
- Treating outliers and missing values in the data
- Run a forward logistic regression model by splitting the dataset in 70-30 train and test to identify the significant variables to categorize a loan applicant
- Running a decision tree and performing parameter tuning to identify best values for cp, minsplit, minbucket in order to attain an ideal tree for classification
- Identifying confidence and support of the two most important decision rules obtained
- Running a Support Vector Machine with fixed cost and tuning 'gamma' parameter for cross validation
- Compared models' performance using overlapping ROC curve and indicatied the best model for classification
